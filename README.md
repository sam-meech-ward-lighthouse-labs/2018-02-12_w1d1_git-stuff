## Git

### VCS

Version control system

- Tracks changes to a file or files. Without having to have multiple copies of each file. 

my_code_file_1.c
my_code_file_2.c
my_code_file_last_changes_i_promise.c


### Git

Git is a british insult. 
Because Linus Torvalds is a git.

- The good:
  - It lives in the directory where you want to track the files.
  - You can easily create remote repo. (github)
  - Distributed. 
    - You end up with copies of the files. 
    - Distribute to other people.
    - Everyone or every machine will get their own copy of a repo, when you share your repo. 
  - Open and has a Command Line interface. 
  - Incredibly fast.
  - Intelligent.
  - You have a lot of control.
  - Comment changes to document your changes.
  - Branching.

- The bad:
  - Intimidating 
  - Command line is opaque


## Git GUI

* github desktop.
* xcode. 
* source tree. 
* tower.

### Workflow

* `git init` to create a new repo
* `git add` to add it to staging. All code that is currently in the file will get added to staging. Any new code that you want to track will have to be `git add`ed.
* `git commit -m` to commit the changes to git
* `git diff` to see the current changes
* `git commit -am` will `git add` all files that have been modified. run `git status` everything that appear red and modified will get added when you do this command.


From the git docs:

```
Running git init in an existing repository is safe. It will not overwrite things that are already there. The primary reason for rerunning git init is to pick up newly added templates.
```

## Committing

- How often should you commit?
- Can you commit too often?
  - NO
- Can you commit too seldom?
  - YES

### Commit Messages

- Make a descriptive message, that's the important thing.

### Branching & Merging

- Use a branch to create a new feature that can be merged back in when it's complete.

- `git branch branch-name` creates a new branch
- `git branch` lists all the branches.
- `git checkout branch-name` to checkout a branch.

How often do we want to write code on master?
  Ideally, never. When creating the boilerplate. 

You _should_ be creating a new branch for every new "feature"

Once you have a branch with a feature that you want to **merge** into master

- `git checkout master` go to the master branch
- `git merge feature-branch` merge feature-branch into master


Every branch is created equal! There are no Sub Branches.

When you're done with a branch `git branch -d wag` 

`git checkout -b bark` Create a new branch and check it out.

### Merge Conflicts

* Happen when two branches modify the same location of code.

### Remotes

github is an example of a remote

A place to store repos that isn't your machine. 

Commands:
- `push` merges your version of the branch, into the remote's version of the branch.
- `pull` merges the remotes version of the branch into your version of the branch.
- `fetch`

### Git & Xcode

Check the git the checkbox when you create a new project. It does the following for you

Go to your project's root dir

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### .gitignore

for the curious, google `.gitignore`
